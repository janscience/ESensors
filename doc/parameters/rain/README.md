# Rain

- DO NOT USE rain sensors based on measuring resistance between some contacts, like e.g. [rain sesnor tutorial](https://lastminuteengineers.com/rain-sensor-arduino-tutorial/), because they corrode!
- better are capacitive rain sensors, see [blog](https://dillinger-engineering.de/kapazitiver-regensensor-mit-einem-esp8266/2020/10/).
- interesting are optical solutions, e.g. [rainsensors.com](https://rainsensors.com/)
- quantitative rain measurements with rain gauges with reed contact, e.g. [beelogger](https://beelogger.de/sensoren/niederschlagsmesser/).
